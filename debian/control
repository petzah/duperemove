Description: Tools for deduping file systems
 Duperemove is a simple tool for finding duplicated extents and
 submitting them for deduplication. When given a list of files it will
 hash their contents on a block by block basis and compare those hashes
 to each other, finding and categorizing extents that match each other.
 .
 Duperemove has two major modes of operation one of which is a subset of
 the other.
